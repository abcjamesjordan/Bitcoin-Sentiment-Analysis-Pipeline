# Data Engineering Portfolio Project
This repository showcases my skills as a Data Engineer through a comprehensive portfolio project. The project utilizes a range of technologies to demonstrate proficiency in data engineering concepts and practices.

The project includes the following key components:

1. Data ingestion from various sources.
2. Data transformation and processing using ETL/ELT pipelines.
3. Data storage in a data warehouse or data lake.
4. Data visualization and reporting.


The project serves as a testament to my ability to design, develop, and implement end-to-end data engineering solutions.

Note:
- this project will be updated as its aims and goals progress throughout the project
